### Mediator pattern
Encapsulates interaction between objects (instead of direct communication) 
leading to coupling reduction between them. The Mediator makes it easy to modify, 
extend and reuse individual components because they are no longer dependent. It
can have its own logic to provide a way of communication.

### Notes:
* The most popular usage of the pattern is facilitating communications between GUI 
components. Hence, the Mediator is the Controller part of MVC pattern.
