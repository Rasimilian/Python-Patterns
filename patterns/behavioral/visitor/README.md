### Visitor pattern
Separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. Thus, allows 
adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchy without altering any existing code.

### Notes:
* Visitor works really well with recursive structures.
* Visitors canâ€™t be simply replaced with method overloading because ambiguous
situations are raised.
