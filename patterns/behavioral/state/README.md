### State pattern
Manages an object's behavior depending on its internal state. It operates 
state-related behaviors separated into classes of the state interface and 
delegates the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.

### Notes:
* Converts massive if-else based state machines into objects.
* Usually, the state transition procedure is implemented to make an object's 
behavior cyclical.
