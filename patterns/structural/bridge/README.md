### Bridge pattern
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation to change them independently. 
It is useful when dealing with objects, apps, instances, APIs of multiple types.
If a class and its implementation are often changed this pattern will be especially
useful as well since we are going to vary them independently.

### Notes:
* The Adapter pattern makes things work after they're designed; Bridge makes them 
work before they are.
