### Decorator pattern
Dynamically adds features to objects without changing their implementations. 
It can be used as an alternative to the subclassing. By changing the behavior
of the concrete object, it avoids adding modifications to the whole class as 
inheritance does. 


### Notes:
* A synonym to Decorator one may meet is Wrapper.
* Decorator and Decorator pattern are two different concepts. Decorator is aimed
at changing functionality and adding new features to method and class at definition time
and is marked as @ in code.
