### Proxy pattern
Provides an object that substitutes a real service object used by a client. 
It is useful when one wants to add functionality to an object without changing
its interface.

### Notes:
* It has almost the same structure as the Adapter, Decorator and Facade patterns.
* Can be used for caching, logging, connection, authorization, accessing, and etc. purposes.
