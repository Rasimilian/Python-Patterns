### 3-tier pattern
This is a software application architecture that separates presentation (UI), 
application processing, and data management functions. Presentation tier stands 
for a GUI. Application tier stands for the application logic: computing, data processing, etc.
Data tier stands for data storage and management systems.


### Notes:
* While MVC pattern is a UI pattern, 3-tier is an application architecture pattern.
* Benefit: each tier can be developed simultaneously and independently.
* N-tier architecture is also possible but rare.
