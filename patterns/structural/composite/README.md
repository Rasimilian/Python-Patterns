### Composite pattern
Allows one to compose objects into a tree-like structure and to work with it
as with its component object. It implements the part-whole hierarchy by aggregating
objects in a class.


### Notes:
* Each component may contain other components.
* At the end of the tree-like structure, there are leaf-like objects which don't contain anything.
* It is possible to add methods to retrieve an object's parent.
