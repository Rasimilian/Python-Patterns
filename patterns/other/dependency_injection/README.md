### Dependency injection pattern
Programming technique in which an object or function receives other objects or 
functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally. It leads to
object decoupling: no need to change client code because an object it depends on
needs to be changed to a different one.

### Notes:
* There are different ways to write a low-coupled code.
