### Blackboard pattern
Provides a computational framework for the design and implementation of systems 
that integrate large and diverse specialized modules, and implement complex, 
non-deterministic control strategies. Several sub-systems work together to solve
the problem where solution is the sum of its parts.

### Notes:
* Blackboard architectural model consists of Knowledge Sources, Controller and Blackboard.
