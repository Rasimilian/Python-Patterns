### Factory method pattern
Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
It defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a 
direct constructor call.

### Notes:
* This pattern is a poor fit for Python since it was designed for underpowered 
programming languages where classes and functions canâ€™t be passed as parameters or 
stored as attributes.
